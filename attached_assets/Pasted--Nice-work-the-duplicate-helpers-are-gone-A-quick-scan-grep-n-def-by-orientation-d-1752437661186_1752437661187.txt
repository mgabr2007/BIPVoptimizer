‚úÖ **Nice work ‚Äî the duplicate helpers are gone.**
A quick scan / `grep -n "def .*_by_orientation\|def group_elements_by_level\|def calculate_height_dependent_solar_angles"` now returns **one line each**, so Python will no longer overwrite functions at import-time.

### Tiny clean-ups you could still make

| `wall_length` loaded in `calculate_precise_shading_factor` but never used                  | Linter will flag this as an *unused variable*.                                                                                                             | Drop the assignment unless you plan to use it later.                   |

| Two `total_area` metrics in the *results* section (one in column 2, one again in column 4) | The second overwrites the first and shows identical data.                                                                                                  | Remove one or rename the metric (e.g. ‚ÄúGlazed Area vs Analysed Area‚Äù). |

Everything else looks consistent, and the single remaining implementations are the DataFrame-aware versions you wanted.

Run your tests / Streamlit app once more to be sure, but you should no longer see the ‚Äúsilently forgotten‚Äù behaviour we talked about earlier. üéâ
