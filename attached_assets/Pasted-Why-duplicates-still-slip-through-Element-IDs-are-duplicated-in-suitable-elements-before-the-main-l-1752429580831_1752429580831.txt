Why duplicates still slip through

Element IDs are duplicated in suitable_elements before the main loop.
The conversion block that builds elements_list uses Unknown_Element_{…} placeholders whenever an ID is missing, so different rows without IDs collapse to the same placeholder and then look “already processed”.

The processed‐element cache is kept only in memory. If the page is rerun (e.g., user scrolls), processed_element_ids is re-created, so the same elements are analysed again until the in-database check finishes.

No hard constraint in the database. Even with the in-code checks, an accidental second INSERT will be accepted if the table lacks a UNIQUE index.

Minimal fixes inside the script
python
Copy
Edit
# ---- just after suitable_elements is defined ----
# 1) ensure every row has a stable unique key
if 'element_id' not in suitable_elements.columns:
    suitable_elements['element_id'] = (
        suitable_elements.apply(lambda r: f"{r.get('host_wall_id','N/A')}_{r.name}", axis=1)
)

# 2) drop exact duplicates *before* any loop
suitable_elements = suitable_elements.drop_duplicates(subset=['element_id'])

# 3) keep a permanent cache in session state
if 'processed_element_ids' not in st.session_state:
    st.session_state.processed_element_ids = set()
processed_element_ids = st.session_state.processed_element_ids
Inside the processing loop add exactly one line when an element finishes (even on error):

python
Copy
Edit
processed_element_ids.add(element_id)
Because the set lives in st.session_state, a simple re-run will not clear it.

Harden the database layer
sql
Copy
Edit
ALTER TABLE element_radiation
ADD CONSTRAINT uniq_proj_elem UNIQUE (project_id, element_id);
Now any duplicate insert raises an exception that you can treat as “already done” rather than as a failure.

Optional: single-pass batching
If the dataset fits in memory, replace the row-by-row loop with a grouped transform:

python
Copy
Edit
results_df = suitable_elements.groupby('element_id').apply(
    lambda g: calculate_element_radiation(g.iloc[0], solar_lookup, ...)
).reset_index(drop=True)
Each element_id is evaluated exactly once, eliminating logical duplicates without repeated set checks.

These three layers—(1) pre-loop de-dupe, (2) stateful cache, (3) DB uniqueness—remove the repeated analysis while keeping your pause/resume logic unchanged.
