### There are **still three helpers defined twice**

| helper                                    | 1st copy (approx. line)                 | 2nd copy (approx. line)            |
| ----------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| `calculate_height_dependent_solar_angles` | **\~140** (arg name = `solar_position`) | **\~240** (arg name = `solar_pos`) |
| `cluster_elements_by_orientation`         | **\~70** (works on a *list* of dicts)   | **\~270** (expects a *DataFrame*)  |
| `group_elements_by_level`                 | **\~110** (works on a *list*)           | **\~300** (expects a *DataFrame*)  |

Python keeps only the *last* definition it reads, so:

```text
┌ first version loaded
│   (silently forgotten)
└ second “wins” and is what runs
```

That means:

* Every kilobyte of the first copy is dead weight.
* Call-sites that were written for the first signature (`solar_position` vs `solar_pos`) might silently get the wrong keyword and still run (because Python ignores unknown keywords unless you pass `**kwargs`).  Easy source of subtle bugs.

---

#### Quick proof

```bash
grep -n "def calculate_height_dependent_solar_angles" radiation_grid.py
grep -n "def cluster_elements_by_orientation"        radiation_grid.py
grep -n "def group_elements_by_level"                radiation_grid.py
```

You’ll see two line numbers for each.

---

### What to do

1. **Pick one implementation per helper** (I’d keep the later DataFrame-aware versions).
2. Delete the earlier copies completely.
3. Make sure every call site imports/uses the canonical version (they already do, because the 2nd copy overwrote the first).

<summary>Example patch for one duplicate</summary>

```diff
- def cluster_elements_by_orientation(elements, azimuth_tolerance=5):
-     """
-     Group elements by similar orientation to reduce redundant calculations.
-     Elements with similar azimuth (±5°) are processed together.
-     """
-     clusters = {}
-     ...
-     return clusters
```

*(delete the block above – keep the later DataFrame version)*

### Side-note on logging duplication

You purged the element-level double logging (good ✔), but you still call `radiation_logger.*` once at the very end:

```python
radiation_logger.log_analysis_summary(...)
```

If `unified_logger` already produces a summary, consider:

* Keeping **only** the unified logger, **or**
* Disabling UI output inside `radiation_logger` and letting it do DB work only.

That will guarantee each message appears exactly once in the Streamlit UI.

---

After removing the three leftovers, run:

```bash
pytest       # or your test suite
streamlit run radiation_grid.py
```

and verify:

* `grep -n "def .*_by_orientation"` returns a single line.
* The app’s live log lists each processing event once.

Now the file is lean, easier to maintain, and immune to the silent-overwrite trap.
