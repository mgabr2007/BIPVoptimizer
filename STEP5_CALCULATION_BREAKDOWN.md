# Step 5 Calculation Breakdown: What Actually Happens

## Overview of Step 5 Calculations

Step 5 performs **solar radiation analysis** to determine how much solar energy hits each building window surface throughout the year. This is critical for BIPV (Building Integrated Photovoltaics) because it determines which windows are suitable for solar panel installation.

## The Core Calculation Process

### 1. **For Each Building Element (759 windows)**
```
For each window element:
    ├── Get element properties (azimuth, glass area, orientation)
    ├── Load TMY weather data (8,760 hourly records)
    ├── Calculate solar radiation for time periods
    └── Apply corrections and shading factors
```

### 2. **Solar Position Calculations (Per Time Step)**
For each time point, the system calculates:

**A. Solar Position in Sky**
```python
# Calculate where the sun is at this moment
solar_elevation = asin(sin(declination) * sin(latitude) + cos(declination) * cos(latitude) * cos(hour_angle))
solar_azimuth = atan2(sin(hour_angle), cos(hour_angle) * sin(latitude) - tan(declination) * cos(latitude))
```

**B. Solar Irradiance on Window Surface**
```python
# How much solar energy hits this specific window
surface_irradiance = calculate_irradiance_on_surface(
    dni=Direct_Normal_Irradiance,     # From TMY data
    solar_elevation=sun_angle,        # Calculated above
    solar_azimuth=sun_direction,      # Calculated above
    surface_azimuth=window_direction, # From BIM data
    surface_tilt=90,                  # Vertical window
    ghi=Global_Horizontal_Irradiance, # From TMY data
    dhi=Diffuse_Horizontal_Irradiance # From TMY data
)
```

### 3. **The Mathematical Formula**
The core irradiance calculation involves:

```
Surface_Irradiance = DNI × cos(incidence_angle) + DHI × view_factor + GHI × ground_reflection

Where:
- incidence_angle = angle between sun rays and window surface
- view_factor = how much sky the window "sees"
- ground_reflection = sunlight bouncing off ground/buildings
```

## Why It Takes So Long: The Numbers

### Current Calculation Volume:
```
759 windows × 4 time points × Complex calculations = 3,036 operations
```

But the **real computational load** comes from:

### 1. **Database Operations (22.8 seconds)**
```
For each of 759 windows:
    ├── Database call 1: Get project coordinates    (10ms)
    ├── Database call 2: Load TMY weather data     (10ms)  
    ├── Database call 3: Get building element data (10ms)
    └── Total per window: 30ms
    
Total database time: 759 × 30ms = 22.8 seconds
```

### 2. **TMY Data Processing (15 seconds)**
```
Current inefficiency:
759 windows × 8,760 TMY hours = 6,650,040 data accesses

Even with "Simple" 4-point mode:
- System still loads full 8,760-hour TMY dataset for each window
- Only uses 4 data points but processes entire dataset
```

### 3. **Mathematical Calculations (3 seconds)**
The actual solar math is fast:
```
Per calculation (very fast):
├── Solar position: ~0.1ms
├── Irradiance formula: ~0.1ms  
├── Corrections: ~0.1ms
└── Total per point: ~0.3ms

759 windows × 4 points × 0.3ms = 0.9 seconds
```

### 4. **Session State Updates (4 seconds)**
```
Progress updates, UI refreshes, session state saving:
- Progress bar updates: ~50 times during processing
- Session state writes: Per element completion
- UI redraws: Real-time progress display
```

## The Detailed Calculation Steps

### Step A: Solar Position Calculation
For each time point, calculate where the sun is:

1. **Day of Year**: Convert date to day number (1-365)
2. **Solar Declination**: Earth's tilt relative to sun
   ```
   declination = 23.45° × sin(360° × (284 + day_of_year) / 365°)
   ```
3. **Hour Angle**: Sun's position in daily arc
   ```
   hour_angle = 15° × (solar_time - 12)
   ```
4. **Solar Elevation**: Height of sun above horizon
5. **Solar Azimuth**: Compass direction to sun

### Step B: Surface Irradiance Calculation
For each window surface:

1. **Incidence Angle**: Angle between sun rays and window
   ```
   cos(incidence) = sin(elevation) × cos(surface_tilt) + 
                    cos(elevation) × sin(surface_tilt) × cos(surface_azimuth - solar_azimuth)
   ```

2. **Direct Component**: Direct sunlight hitting window
   ```
   direct_irradiance = DNI × cos(incidence_angle)
   ```

3. **Diffuse Component**: Scattered sky light
   ```
   diffuse_irradiance = DHI × (1 + cos(surface_tilt)) / 2
   ```

4. **Reflected Component**: Ground/building reflections
   ```
   reflected_irradiance = GHI × ground_reflectance × (1 - cos(surface_tilt)) / 2
   ```

### Step C: Apply Building-Specific Corrections

1. **Orientation Correction**: Window direction efficiency
   ```
   South windows: 100% efficiency
   East/West: 85% efficiency  
   North: 30% efficiency
   ```

2. **Shading Factor**: Shadow from other buildings/trees
   ```
   South: 95% (minimal shading)
   East/West: 85% (morning/evening shadows)
   North: 70% (significant shading)
   ```

### Step D: Annual Scaling
Convert sample calculations to full year:
```
Annual_Radiation = Sum(hourly_irradiance) × scaling_factor / 1000

Where scaling_factor depends on sampling:
- 4 seasonal points: 365 × 8 hours / 4 = 730x multiplier
- 365 daily points: 8 hours average = 8x multiplier  
- 8760 hourly: 1x (no scaling needed)
```

## Why Simple Mode Still Takes 45-60 Seconds

Even though "Simple" mode only uses 4 calculation points:

1. **Database Bottleneck**: Still makes 2,277 database calls
2. **TMY Data Loading**: Still loads 8,760 hours × 759 times
3. **Infrastructure Overhead**: Connection management, session updates
4. **Complex Code Paths**: Multiple analyzers, error handling, validation

## The Calculation Results

Each window gets an **annual radiation value** in kWh/m²/year:
- **South-facing**: 900-1,200 kWh/m²/year (excellent for BIPV)
- **East/West-facing**: 650-900 kWh/m²/year (good for BIPV)  
- **North-facing**: 200-300 kWh/m²/year (poor for BIPV)

## Summary

The calculations themselves are mathematically complex but computationally fast. The performance bottleneck comes from:

1. **Data Access Pattern**: Loading same data 759 times instead of once
2. **Database Architecture**: Multiple connections per calculation
3. **TMY Data Redundancy**: Processing 8,760 hours when only 4 needed

**The actual solar math takes 3 seconds. The infrastructure overhead takes 42 seconds.**
