    ### Welcome to the BIPV Optimizer Platform
    
    **Building-Integrated Photovoltaics (BIPV)** represents the future of sustainable architecture, 
    where solar energy generation seamlessly integrates with building design. Our platform provides 
    comprehensive analysis and optimization tools for BIPV installations, specifically focusing on 
    **semi-transparent PV glass replacement** in educational and commercial buildings.

        #### What is BIPV Glass Replacement?
        
        BIPV glass replacement involves **substituting conventional window glass** with semi-transparent 
        photovoltaic panels that serve dual functions:
        
        1. **Energy Generation:** Convert sunlight into electricity
        2. **Building Function:** Maintain natural lighting and weather protection
        3. **Aesthetic Integration:** Preserve architectural design integrity
        
        Our platform specifically analyzes **window-to-BIPV conversions** where existing glass areas 
        are replaced with semi-transparent PV modules, optimizing both energy performance and 
        building functionality.

    ### Ready to Begin?
    
    Start your BIPV analysis journey by navigating to **Step 1: Project Setup** in the sidebar. 
    Each step builds upon the previous analysis, creating a comprehensive optimization study 
    for your building's BIPV potential.
    
    **Important:** Complete each step in sequence, as later steps depend on data from earlier analyses.
